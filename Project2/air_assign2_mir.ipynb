    "*Feature extraction* is a crucial part of content-based approaches. The goal is to transform and reduce the information provided by the digital audio signal into a set of semantically descriptive numbers. A typical CD quality mainstream radio track has an average length of three minutes. This means, that song is digitally described in Pulse-code Modulation (PCM) by 15.9 million numbers (3 [minutes] x 60 [seconds] x 2 [stereo channels] x 44100 [sampling rate]). Using CD-quality 16bit encoding this information requires 30.3MB of memory. Besides music specific reasons, the computational obstacles concerned with processing of huge music collections make raw audio processing a suboptimal solution. Feature design and implementation tries to overcome technological obstacles of digital audio and to extract essential music properties that can be used to analyze, compare or classify music. \n",

    "1. A common way to evaluate the performance of a machine learning approach is to perform a cross-validation. For this exercise you will be using a stratified K-Fold cross-validation. A K-Fold cross-validation splits the data-set into K equally-sized parts and uses K-1 parts to train the classifier and the remaining part to test it. The stratification asserts that the frequency distribution of the class labels within the folds corresponds to the original distribution of the ground-truth assignment. As a first step create a shuffled *StratifiedKFold* cross-validation object which generated 10 *splits* (10-fold cross-validation).<br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "    2.1. Pre-process the feature-space: audio features are usually abstract content descriptors and have varying value ranges. Many machine learning algorithms expect all features to have the same value ranges. Thus, varying ranges will have a bias towards features with high value ranges. You will use Zero-Mean Unit-Variance Normalization - also referred to as Z-Score normalization or standardization, which subtracts the mean value from each feature and divides it by its variance. An important fact to note here, is that the parameters of the scaler are part of the trained classification model. They have to be assessed from the training-split, because the test-split is supposed to be unseen data. Use the sklearn *StandardScaler* and process the feature-data similar to the *LabelEncoder* by fitting the scaler using only the training-instances. After fitting the scaler transform the feature vectors of the training-split (but do not overwrite the original features!).<br>\n",
    "    2.2. You will use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to train a model for automatic genre prediction. The sklearn recently made some efforts to standardize their APIs. Thus, also the SVM classifier adheres to the same pattern. First, create a *LinearSVC* classifier using its default parameters. Then, train the SVM using the *fit* method by supplying the train-split of the feature vecotrs and the ground-truth labels.<br>\n",
    "    2.3. similar to 2.1. standardize the test-split using the already fitted scaler.<br>\n",
    "    2.4. use the fitted SVM to predict the scaled test-split feature vectors using its *predict* method.<br>\n",
